# SOCS0100_Assignment
## The code aims to help researchers better analyze data about people's use of electricity or clean fuels for cooking in different countries at several periods.
## Requirement
### We need several R packages to ensure the code can run;
#### 1.tidyverse;
#### 2.kableExtra;
#### 3.flextable;
#### 4.glue;
#### 5.ggplot2;
#### 6.gridExtra 
### Due to multiple data processing operations, please proceed in order;
### Please download the file ['The share of the population with access to electricity and clean fuels for cooking (World Bank, 2021)'](https://github.com/owid/owid-datasets/blob/master/datasets/Number%20of%20people%20with%20and%20without%20energy%20access%20(OWID%20based%20on%20World%20Bank%2C%202021)/Number%20of%20people%20with%20and%20without%20energy%20access%20(OWID%20based%20on%20World%20Bank%2C%202021).csv)
## Functions
### You will get four functions to quickly assist you in completing research tasks.
#### 1.QuickSelect-quickly select the data by country name and collection year.Example-QuickSelect("Country name", Year);
#### 2.plot1-displays the proportion of people using electricity and clean energy for cooking over time in select country. Example-plot1("Country name");
#### 3.plot2-automatically plot the changes in various variables over time. Example-plot2("Variabl name");
#### 4.plot3-draw box plots for selected variables. Example-plot3("Year", "Variable name")
